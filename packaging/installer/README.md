# Installation guide

Netdata is a monitoring agent designed to run on all your systems: physical and virtual servers, containers, even
IoT/edge devices. Netdata runs on Linux, FreeBSD, macOS, Kubernetes, Docker, and all their derivatives.

The best way to install Netdata is with our **automatic one-line installation script**, which works with all Linux
distributions. To see other installation methods, such as those for different operating systems including alternatives
to the one-line installer script, see [Have a different operating system, or want to try another
method?](#have-a-different-operating-system-or-want-to-try-another-method)

Some third parties, such as the packaging teams at various Linux distributions, distribute old, broken, or altered
packages. We recommend you install Netdata using one of the above methods to guarantee you get the latest and
checksum-verified packages.

Starting with v1.12, Netdata collects anonymous usage information by default and sends it to Google Analytics. Read
about the information collected, and learn how to-opt, on our [anonymous statistics](docs/anonymous-statistics.md) page.

The usage statistics are _vital_ for us, as we use them to discover bugs and priortize new features. We thank you for
_actively_ contributing to Netdata's future.

This method is fully automatic on all Linux distributions. To install Netdata from source and get _automatic nightly
updates_, run the following:

```bash
bash <(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart.sh)
```

## One-line installation

![](https://registry.my-netdata.io/api/v1/badge.svg?chart=web_log_nginx.requests_per_url&options=unaligned&dimensions=kickstart&group=sum&after=-3600&label=last+hour&units=installations&value_color=orange&precision=0) ![](https://registry.my-netdata.io/api/v1/badge.svg?chart=web_log_nginx.requests_per_url&options=unaligned&dimensions=kickstart&group=sum&after=-86400&label=today&units=installations&precision=0)

This method is **fully automatic on all Linux distributions**. FreeBSD and macOS systems need some preparation before installing Netdata for the first time. Check the [FreeBSD](OTHERS.md#freebsd) or the [MacOS](OTHERS.md#macos) installation instructions for more information.

To install Netdata from source and get **automatic, nightly** updates, run the following:

```bash
bash <(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart.sh)
```

!!! note "Usage notes"
    Do not use `sudo` for the one-line installerâ€”it escalates privileges itself if needed.

    To learn more about the pros and cons of using *nightly* vs. *stable* releases, see our [notice about the two options](#nightly-vs-stable-releases).

<details markdown="1"><summary>More information and advanced uses of the kickstart.sh script</summary>

**What `kickstart.sh` does:**

The `kickstart.sh` script:

- Detects the Linux distro and installs the required system packages for building Netdata after asking for confirmation.
- Downloads the latest Netdata source tree to `/usr/src/netdata.git`.
- Installs Netdata by running `./netdata-installer.sh` from the source tree.
- Installs `netdata-updater.sh` to `cron.daily`, so your Netdata installation updates daily.
- Outputs details about whether the installation succeeded or failed.

**Available options:**

You can customize your Netdata installation by passing options from `kickstart.sh` to `netdata-installer.sh`. With these options, you can change the installation directory, enable/disable automatic updates, choose between the nightly (default) or stable channel, enable/disable plugins, and much more. For a full list of options, see the [`netdata-installer.sh` script](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/netdata-installer.sh#L149-L177).

Here are a few popular options:

- `--stable-channel`: Automatically update only on the release of new major versions.
- `--no-updates`: Prevent automatic updates of any kind.
- `--dont-wait`: Enable automated installs by not prompting for permission to install any required packages.
- `--dont-start-it`: Prevent the installer from starting Netdata automatically.

Here's an example of how to pass a few options through `kickstart.sh`:

```bash
bash <(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart.sh) --dont-wait --dont-start-it --stable-channel
```

**Verify the script's integrity:**

Verify the integrity of the script with this:

```bash
[ "8a2b054081a108dff915994ce77f2f2d" = "$(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart.sh | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)" ] && echo "OK, VALID" || echo "FAILED, INVALID"
```

This command outputs `OK, VALID` to confirm that the script is intact and that no one has tampered with it.

Once you have installed Netdata, see our [getting started guide](../../docs/GettingStarted.md).


## Binary packages 
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netdata/netdata/master/web/gui/images/packaging-beta-tag.svg?sanitize=true)

In the effort to make Netdata's installation process easy and fully automated on as many operating systems as possible, we have begun providing binary packages for the most common Linux distributions that use `.RPM` or `.DEB` packaging formats.

We have currently released `.RPM` packages with version 1.16.0. We plan to release `.DEB` packages with version 1.17.0. Until then, early adopters can experiment with our `.DEB` packages using our nightly releases.

We provide two separate repositories, one for our stable releases and one for our nightly releases. See this notice about [stable vs. nightly](#nightly-vs-stable-releases) for more information. Our current packaging infrastructure provider is [Package Cloud](https://packagecloud.io). You can visit the repository pages to read more or try the set-up commands to get started.

**Stable releases:** Our stable production releases are hosted in the [netdata/netdata](https://packagecloud.io/netdata/netdata) repository on Packagecloud.

Use the following command to add our stable repository to your system's package manager:

```bash
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/netdata/netdata/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash
```

**Nightly releases:** Our latest releases are hosted in the [netdata/netdata-edge](https://packagecloud.io/netdata/netdata-edge) repository on Packagecloud.

Use the following command to add our nightly repository to your system's package manager:

```bash
# .RPM (openSUSE, Fedora, RHEL)
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/netdata/netdata-edge/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash

# .DEB (Debian, Ubuntu)
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/netdata/netdata-edge/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
```

Once you have installed Netdata, see our [getting started guide](../../docs/GettingStarted.md).


## Nightly vs. stable releases

The Netdata team maintains two releases of the Netdata agent: **nightly** and **stable**. By default, Netdata's installation scripts give you **automatic, nightly** updates, as that is our recommended configuration.

**Nightly**: We create nightly builds every 24 hours. They contain fully-tested code that fixes bugs or security flaws, or introduces new features to Netdata. Every nightly release is a candidate for then becoming a stable release; when we're ready, we change the release tags on GitHub. That means nightly releases are stable and proven to function correctly in the vast majority of Netdata use cases. That's why nightly is the *best choice for most Netdata users*.

**Stable**: We create stable releases whenever we believe the code has reached a major milestone. Most often, stable releases correlate with the introduction of new, significant features. Stable releases might be a better choice for those who run Netdata in *mission-critical production systems*, as updates come more infrequently, and only after the community helps fix any bugs we might have inadvertently introduced in previous releases.

**Pros of using nightly releases:**

  - Get the latest features and bug fixes as soon as they're available
  - Receive security-related fixes immediately
  - Use stable, fully-tested code that's always improving
  - Leverage the same Netdata experience our community is using

**Pros of using stable releases:**

# kickstart-static64.sh
bash kickstart-static64.sh --local-files /tmp/netdata-version-number-here.gz.run /tmp/sha256sums.txt
```

Now that you're finished with your offline installation, you can move on to our [getting started
guide](../../docs/getting-started.md) for a quick overview of configuring Netdata, enabling plugins, and controlling
Netdata's daemon. Or, get the full guided tour of Netdata's capabilities with our [step-by-step
tutorial](../../docs/step-by-step/step-00.md)!

## Automatic updates

By default, Netdata's installation scripts enable automatic updates for both nightly and stable release channels.

If you would prefer to update your Netdata agent manually, you can disable automatic updates by using the `--no-updates` option when you install or update Netdata using the [one-line installation script](#one-line-installation).

```bash
# kickstart.sh
bash <(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart.sh) --no-updates

# kickstart-static64.sh
bash <(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart-static64.sh) --no-updates
```

With automatic updates disabled, you can choose when and how you [update Netdata](UPDATE.md).
