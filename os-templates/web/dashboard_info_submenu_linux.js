KSM is a memory-saving de-duplication feature in the Linux kernel (since version 2.6.32). The KSM daemon ksmd periodically scans those areas of user memory which have been registered with it, looking for pages of identical content which can be replaced by a single write-protected page (which is automatically copied if a process later wants to update its content). KSM was originally developed for use with KVM (where it was known as Kernel Shared Memory), to fit more virtual machines into physical memory, by sharing the data common between them.  But it can be useful to any application which generates many instances of the same data.'

It is optimized to handle millions of packets per second utilizing all CPUs available without any concurrency locking between the connections. It can be used for any kind of TCP traffic (even encrypted), since it does not interfere with the content itself.'
