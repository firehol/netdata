# Web dashboards overview

Because Netdata is a health monitoring and *performance troubleshooting* system, we put a lot of emphasis on real-time, meaningful, and context-aware charts.

We then leverage a number of dashboards, both configured by the Netdata community and customizeable by you, so you can easily see anomalies, jump between charts to find correlations, and generally make smarter decisions about your systems and applications.

There are two primary ways to view Netdata's dashboards:

1. The [standard web dashboard](gui/#the-standard-web-dashboard) that comes pre-configured with every Netdata installation and is accessed at `http://SERVER-IP:19999`, or `http://localhost:19999` on `localhost`. This dashboard can be [customized using JavaScript](gui/#customizing-the-standard-dashboards).

2. The `dashboard.js` JavaScript library, which helps you [customize the standard dashboards](gui/#customizing-the-standard-dashboards) using JavaScript, or create entirely new [custom dashboards](gui/custom/) and [Atlassian Confluence dashboards](gui/confluence/).

You can also view all the data Netdata collects through the [REST API v1](api/).


## Charts, contexts, families

Before customizing the standard web dashboard, creating a custom dashboard, configuring an alarm, or writing a collector, it's important to understand how Netdata organizes metrics into charts, dimensions, families, and contexts.

### Charts

A **chart** is an individual, interactive, always-updating graphic displaying one or more collected/calculated metrics. Charts are generated by [collectors](../collectors/). 

Here's the system CPU chart, the first chart displayed on the standard dashboard:

![Screenshot of the system CPU chart in the Netdata dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/62720972-0b8a8e80-b9c0-11e9-930b-4829f7b17cfd.png)

A chart's name is displayed in parentheses above the chart. For example, if you navigate to the system CPU chart, , you'll see the label: **Total CPU utilization (system.cpu)**. In this case, the chart's name is `system.cpu`. The name is derived from the chart's [context](#contexts)

### Dimensions

A **dimension** is a value that gets shows on a chart. The value can be raw data or calculated values, such as percentages, aggregates, and more.

Charts are capable of showing more than one dimension. All of these dimensions will be shown on the right side of the chart, beneath the date and time. Again, the `system.cpu` chart will serve as a good example.

![Screenshot of the dimensions shown in the system CPU chart in the Netdata dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/62721031-2bba4d80-b9c0-11e9-9dca-32403617ce72.png)

Here, the `system.cpu` chart is showing many dimensions, such as `user`, `system`, `softirq`, `irq`, and more.

Note that other applications sometimes use the word *series* instead of dimension.

### Families

A **family** is *one* instance of a monitored hardware or software resource that needs to be monitored and displayed separately from similar instances. 

For example, if your system has multiple disk drives at `sda` and `sdb`, Netdata will put each interface into their own family. Same goes for software resoruces, like multiple MySQL instances. We call these instances "families" because the charts associated with a single disk instance, for example, are often related to each other. Relatives, family... get it?

When relevant, Netdata prefers to organize charts by family. When you visit the **Disks** section, you will see your disk drives organized into families, and each family will have one or more charts: `disk`, `disk_ops`, `disk_backlog`, `disk_util`, `disk_await`, `disk_avgsz`, `disk_svctm`, `disk_mops`, and `disk_iotime`.

In the screenshot below, the disk family `sdb` shows a few gauges, followed by a few of the associated charts:

Netdata also creates separate submenu entries for each family in the right navigation page so you can easily navigate to the instance you're interested in. Here, Netdata has made a number of submenus under the **Disk** menu.

![Screenshot of the disks menu and submenus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/62721531-3cb78e80-b9c1-11e9-89c2-fdd736aec7d4.png)

### Contexts

A **context** is a way of grouping charts by the types of metrics collected and dimensions displayed. Different charts with the same context will show exactly the same dimensions, but for different instances (families) of hardware/software resources.

For example, the **Disks** section will often use a number of contexts (`disk.io`, `disk.ops`, `disk.backlog`, `disk.util`, and so on). Netdata then creates an individual chart for each context, and groups them by family.

Netdata names charts according to their context according to the following structure: `[context].[family]`. A chart with the `disk.util` context, in the `sdb` family, gets the name `disk_util.sdb`. Netdata shows that name in the top-left corner of a chart.

Given the four example contexts, and two families of `sdb` and `sdd`, Netdata will create the following charts and their names:

Context | `sdb` family | `sdd` family
---  | ---    | ---
`disk.io` | `disk_io.sdb` | `disk_io.sdd`
`disk.ops` | `disk_ops.sdb` | `disk_ops.sdd`
`disk.backlog` | `disk_backlog.sdb` | `disk_backlog.sdd`
`disk.util` | `disk_util.sdb` | `disk_util.sdd`

And here's what two of those charts in the `disk.io` context look like under `sdb` and `sdd` families:

![context_01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/62728232-177e4c80-b9d0-11e9-9e29-2a6c59d4d873.png)
![context_02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/62728234-1b11d380-b9d0-11e9-8904-07befd8ac592.png)

As you can see in the screenshot, you can view the context of a chart if you hover over the date above the list of dimensions. A tooltip will appear that shows you two pieces of information: the collector that produces the chart, and the chart's context.

Contexts are also used for alarm templates. You can create an alarm for the `net.packets` context to receive alerts for any chart with that context, no matter which family it's attached to.
