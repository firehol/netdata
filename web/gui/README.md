# Netdata agent web dashboards

> > > Intro goes here

## The standard web dashboard

By default, Netdata starts a web server for its dashboard at port `19999`. Open up your web browser of choice and navigate to `http://SERVER-IP:19999`, or `http://localhost:19999` on `localhost`.

### Generating dashboard.js

The monolithic `dashboards.js` file is automatically generated by concatenating the source files located in the `web/gui/src/dashboard.js/` directory by running the build script:

```sh
cd web/gui
make
```

After every change in the `src` directory, the `dashboard.js` file should be regenerated and commited to the repository.

## Customizing the standard dashboard

Charts information is stored at /usr/share/netdata/web/[dashboard_info.js](dashboard_info.js). This file includes information that is rendered on the dashboard, controls chart colors, section and subsection heading, titles, etc.

If you change that file, your changes will be overwritten when Netdata is updated. You can preserve your settings by creating a new such file (there is /usr/share/netdata/web/[dashboard_info_custom_example.js](dashboard_info_custom_example.js) you can use to start with).

You have to copy the example file under a new name, so that it will not be overwritten with Netdata updates.

To configure your info file set in netdata.conf:

```
[web]
   custom dashboard_info.js = your_file_name.js
```

## Custom dashboards

For information on creating custom dashboards, see the [custom dashboards](custom/)** or **[Atlassian Confluence dashboards](confluence/) guides.
