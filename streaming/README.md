# Streaming

Each node running Netdata can stream the metrics it collects, in real time, to another node. 

If you're a user who wants to use streaming with your Netdata installations, start by reading the [how streaming
works](/docs/metrics-storage-management/how-streaming-works.mdx) doc. Next, check out the [streaming
quickstart](/docs/metrics-storage-management/enable-streaming.mdx) or the [reference
doc](/docs/metrics-storage-management/reference-streaming.mdx)

Developers interested in contributing to Netdata's streaming code can find all the relevant files in this directory.
