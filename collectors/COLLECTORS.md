# Netdata collectors support list

Netdata has 200+ collectors to help you gather metrics from your favorite services and applications and view them in
real-time, interactive charts. The following list includes collectors for both internal system metrics, and external
services/applications metrics.

Read more about collectors and how to enable them in our [collectors documentation](README.md). 

If you don't see the service/application you'd like to monitor here, check out our [GitHub
issues](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/issues). Use the search bar to look for previous discussions about that
collectorâ€”we may be looking for contributions from users such as yourself!
