# Installation
#
# Private REST API needs to be configured first:
#
#         1. Set 'JVB_OPTS="--apis=rest"' in /etc/jitsi/videobridge/config
#
#         2. Set 'org.jitsi.videobridge.rest.private.jetty.host=127.0.0.1' in
#            /etc/jitsi/videobridge/sip-communicator.properties
#
# Then simply copy this file into /usr/libexec/netdata/python.d/jitsi.chart.py
# and restart netdata.
