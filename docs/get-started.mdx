# Install Netdata

Netdata is an free and open-source (FOSS) monitoring agent that collects thousands of hardware and software metrics from
any physical or virtual system (we call them _nodes_) and organizes them in easy-to-use and -navigate interface.

Together with Netdata Cloud, you can monitor your entire infrastructure in real time and troubleshoot problems that
threaten the health of your nodes before they occur.

Netdata runs permanently on all your physical/virtual servers, containers, cloud deployments, and edge/IoT devices. It
runs on Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, and more), container/microservice platforms (Kubernetes clusters,
Docker), and many other operating systems (FreeBSD, macOS), with no `sudo` required.

The best way to install Netdata is to use the **[one-line kickstart script on Linux](#install-netdata-on-linux)** or
**[run with Docker](#run-netdata-with-docker)**. Many Linux distributions ship with third-party packages of Netdata,
which we can't maintain and are often missing features. By installing from a method listed here, you'll get the complete
Netdata experience.

## Install Netdata on Linux

The **recommended** way to install Netdata on a Linux node (physical, virtual, container, IoT) is our one-line
[kickstart script](/packaging/installer/methods/kickstart.md). This script automatically installs dependencies and
builds Netdata from its source code.

Copy the script, paste it into your node's terminal, and hit `Enter` to begin the installation process.

<OneLineInstall />

Jump down to [what's next](#whats-next) to learn how to view your new dashboard and take your next steps monitoring and
troubleshooting with Netdata.

## Run Netdata with Docker

You can also try out Netdata's capabilities in a [Docker container](/packaging/docker/README.md). Copy the following
`docker run` command into your node and hit `Enter` to download and run the container.

```bash
docker run -d --name=netdata \
  -p 19999:19999 \
  -v netdataconfig:/etc/netdata \
  -v netdatalib:/var/lib/netdata \
  -v netdatacache:/var/cache/netdata \
  -v /etc/passwd:/host/etc/passwd:ro \
  -v /etc/group:/host/etc/group:ro \
  -v /proc:/host/proc:ro \
  -v /sys:/host/sys:ro \
  -v /etc/os-release:/host/etc/os-release:ro \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --cap-add SYS_PTRACE \
  --security-opt apparmor=unconfined \
  netdata/netdata
```

## What's next?

To start using Netdata, open a browser and navigate to `http://NODE:19999`, replacing `NODE` with either `localhost` or
the hostname/IP address of a remote node.

Where you go from here is based on your use case, immediate needs, and experience with monitoring and troubleshooting.

### Dashboard

Learn more about [how the dashboard works](/docs/dashboard/how-dashboard-works.mdx), or dive directly into the many ways
to [interact with charts](/docs/dashboard/interact-charts.mdx).

### Configuration

Discover the recommended way to [configure Netdata's settings or behavior](/docs/configure/nodes.md) using our built-in
`edit-config` script, then apply that knowledge to mission-critical tweaks, such as [changing how long Netdata stores
metrics](/docs/store/change-metrics-storage.md).

### Data collection

If Netdata didn't autodetect all the hardware, containers, services, or applications running on your node, you should
learn more about [how data collectors work](/docs/collect/how-collectors-work.md). If there's a [supported
collector](/collectors/COLLECTORS.md) for metrics you need, [configure the collector](/docs/collect/enable-configure.md)
or read about its requirements to configure your endpoint to publish metrics in the correct format and endpoint.

### Alarms & notifications

Netdata comes with hundreds of preconfigured alarms, designed by our monitoring gurus in parallel with our open-source
community, but you may want to [edit alarms](/docs/monitor/configure-alarms.md) or [enable
notifications](/docs/monitor/enable-notifications.md) to customize your Netdata experience.

### Need to monitor multiple nodes in one place?

For robust multi-node monitoring from a single interface, consider [Netdata
Cloud](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/cloud), which streams, aggregates, and visualizes metrics from any number of
nodes. It's all the same out-of-the-box, zero-configuration functionality of the open-source monitoring agent, but for
any number of distributed nodes, _entirely for free_.

There is an alternative for those who aren't interested in using Netdata Cloud, albeit with some required configuration.
Each node can [stream](/streaming/README.md) its metrics to any other node, and the default
[registry](/registry/README.md) is configurable to create a private "network" of Netdata dashboards.
