# Monitor, troubleshoot, and debug applications with eBPF metrics

When trying to troubleshoot or debug a finicky appliction, there's no such thing as too much information. At Netdata, we
developed programs that connect to the [_extended Berkeley Packet Filter_ (eBPF) virtual
machine](/collectors/ebpf.plugin/README.md) to help you see exactly how specific applications are interacting with the
Linux kernel. With these charts, you can root out bugs, discover optimizations, diagnose memory leaks, and much more.

This means you can see exactly how often, and in what volume, the process creates processes, opens files, writes to the
virtual file system (VFS), and much more. Even better, the eBPF collector gathers metrics at an _event frequency_, which
is even faster than Netdata's beloved 1-second granularity. When you troubleshoot and debug applications with eBPF, rest
assured you miss not even the smallest meaningful event.

Using this guide, you'll learn the fundamentals of setting up Netdata to give you kernel-level metrics from your
application so that you can monitor, troubleshoot, and debug to your heart's content.

## Configure `apps.plugin` to recognize your custom application

To start troubleshooting an application with eBPF metrics, you need to ensure your Netdata dashboard collects and
displays those metrics independent from any other process.

You can use the `apps_groups.conf` file to configure which applications appear in charts generated by
[`apps.plugin`](/collectors/apps.plugin/README.md). Once you edit this file and create a new group for your application,
you can see how it's interacting with the Linux kernel via real-time eBPF metrics.

For this guide, we'll pretend we're a Mozilla developer who wants to better understand how the Firefox browser interacts
with the Linux kernel.

Open the `apps_groups.conf` file in your Netdata configuration directory.

```bash
cd /etc/netdata   # Replace this path with your Netdata config directory
sudo ./edit-config apps_groups.conf
```

Scroll down to the `X` section.

Remove any references to `firefox`, including any wildcards around the process names, and create a new line reading
`firefox: *firefox*`. This instructs `apps.plugin` to put any processes containing `firefox` in them in the `firefox`
group, which in turn allows you to view eBPF metrics for that application independently.

> If you want to monitor a different application, replace `*firefox*` with the name of that application's process name.

In the end, the `X` section should look like this:

```conf
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# X

X: X Xorg xinit lightdm xdm pulseaudio gkrellm xfwm4 xfdesktop xfce* Thunar
X: xfsettingsd xfconfd gnome-* gdm gconf* dconf* xfconf* *gvfs gvfs* slim
X: kdeinit* kdm plasmashell
X: evolution-* chromium opera vivaldi-bin epiphany WebKit*
X: '*systemd --user*' chrome *chrome-sandbox* *google-chrome* *chromium*

firefox: *firefox*
```

Restart Netdata with `sudo service netdata restart` or the appropriate method for your system.

## Get familiar with per-application eBPF metrics and charts

Visit the Netdata dashboard at `http://NODE:19999`, replacing `NODE` with the hostname or IP of the system you're using
to monitor this application. Scroll down to the **Applications** section. These charts now feature a `firefox` dimension
with metrics specific to that process. 

Pay particular attention to the charts in the **ebpf syscall** and **ebpf net** sections. These charts are populated my
low-level Linux kernel metrics thanks to eBPF, and showcase the volume of calls to open/close files, call functions like
`do_fork`, IO activity on the VFS, and much more.

See the [eBPF collector
documentation](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/agent/collectors/ebpf.plugin#integration-with-appsplugin) for the full
list of per-application charts.

For example, the following screenshot shows how Firefox closes files, deletes files, and writes to the VFS over the
course of a few minutes.

## Troubleshoot and debug applications with eBPF

The actual process of troubleshooting and debugging any application with Netdata's eBPF metrics depends on the type of
application you're monitoring and what kind of issues you're trying to trace.

## View eBPF metrics in Netdata Cloud

You can also show per-application eBPF metrics in Netdata Cloud. This could be particularly useful if you're running the
same application on multiple systems and want to correlate how it performs on each target, or if you want to share your
findings with someone else on your team.

If you don't already have a Netdata Cloud account, go [sign in](https://app.netdata.cloud) and get started for free.
Read the [get started with Cloud guide](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/cloud/get-started) for a walkthrough of node
claiming and other fundamentals.

Add more metrics to the Nodes view by clicking on the **Add metric** button, then typing `apps.` into the context field.
Choose the eBPF contexts you want to add. Then, you can choose to show just the `firefox` dimension.
