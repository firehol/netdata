# Enable streaming between nodes

The simplest streaming configuration is **replication**, in which a child node streams its metrics in real time to a
parent node, and both nodes retain metrics in their own databases.



## Enable streaming on the parent node

First, log onto the node that will act as the parent.

Run `uuidgen` to create a new API key, which is a randomly-generated machine GUID the Netdata Agent uses to identify
itself while initiating a streaming connection. Copy that into a separate text file for later use.

Next, open `stream.conf` using [`edit-config`](/docs/configure/nodes.md#use-edit-config-to-edit-configuration-files)
from within the [Netdata config directory](/docs/configure/nodes.md#the-netdata-config-directory).

```bash
cd /etc/netdata
sudo ./edit-config stream.conf
```

Scroll down to the section beginning with `[API_KEY]`. Paste the API key you generated earlier between the brackets, so
that it looks like the following:

```conf
[11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555]
```

Set `enabled` to `yes`, and `default memory mode` to `dbengine`. Leave all the other settings as their defaults. A
simplified version of the configuration, minus the commented lines, looks like the following:

```conf
[11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555]
    enabled = yes
    default memory mode = dbengine
```

Save the file and close it, then restart Netdata with `sudo systemctl restart netdata`, or the [appropriate
method](/docs/configure/start-stop-restart.md) for your system.

## Enable streaming on the child node

Log into the node that will act as the child.

Open `stream.conf` again. Scroll down to the section beginning with `[stream]`. Set `enabled` to `yes`. Paste the IP
address of your parent node at the end of the `destination` line, and paste the API key generated on the parent node
onto the `api key` line.

Leave all the other settings as their defaults. A simplified version of the configuration, minus the commented lines,
looks like the following:

```conf
[stream]
    enabled = yes 
    destination = 203.0.113.0
    api key = 11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555
```

Save the file and close it, then restart Netdata with `sudo systemctl restart netdata`, or the [appropriate
method](/docs/configure/start-stop-restart.md) for your system.

## View streamed metrics in Netdata's dashboards

At this point, the child node is streaming its metrics in real time to its parent. Open the local Agent dashboard for
the parent by navigating to `http://PARENT-NODE:19999` in your browser, replacing `PARENT-NODE` with its IP address or
hostname.

This dashboard shows parent metrics. To see child metrics, open the left-hand sidebar with the hamburger icon in the top
navigation. Both nodes appear under the **Replicated Nodes** menu. Click on either of the links to switch between
separate parent and child dashboards.

The child dashboard is also available directly at `http://PARENT-NODE:19999/host/CHILD-HOSTNAME`, which in this example
is `http://203.0.113.0:19999/host/netdata-child`.

## What's next?

Now that you have a basic streaming setup with replication, you may want to tweak the configuration to eliminate the
child database, disable the child dashboard, or enable SSL on the streaming connection between the parent and child.

See the [streaming reference doc](/streaming/README.md#supported-streaming-configurations) for details about other
possible configurations.

When using Netdata's default TSDB (`dbengine`), the parent node maintains separate, parallel databases for itself and
every child node streaming to it. Each instance is sized identically based on the `dbengine multihost disk space`
setting in `netdata.conf`. See our doc on [changing metrics retention](/docs/store/change-metrics-strorage.md) for
details.
