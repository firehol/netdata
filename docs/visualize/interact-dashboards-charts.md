# Interact with dashboards and charts

In the previous doc about [viewing all nodes](/docs/visualize/view-all-nodes.md), along with the
[single-node](/docs/quickstart/single-node.md) and [infrastructure](/docs/quickstart/infrastructure.md) quickstart
guides, we discussed both local and Cloud dashboards. While you access these dashboards differently, they similar
interfaces, and if you're looking at both dashboards for the same node, they contain exactly the same charts and
metrics.

You also interact with dashboards and charts the same way on both platforms. Let's talk about how to navigate
dashboards, followed by the fundamentals of interacting with charts.

## Dashboards

Netdata dashboards are a single, scrollable page with many charts stacked on top of one another. As you scroll up or
down, charts load and auto-update every second as long as they're in the visible viewport.

The dashboard is broken up into multiple **sections**, such as **System Overview**, **CPU**, **Disk**, and more. Inside
each section you'll find a number of charts, broken down into contexts and families. More on those in a moment.

**Menus** are located on the right-hand side of the Netdata dashboard. You can use these to navigate to types of charts
you're most interested in. Many menus also create **submenus**, which the Netdata Agent populates automatically based on
the node's hardware or the types of metrics collected.

submenus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/80832425-7c528600-8ba1-11ea-8140-d0a17a62009b.gif)

## Charts

Charts are interactive so that you can find exactly the right information at exactly the right moment in time. You can
show or hide dimensions and resize each chart to see more your node's metrics in more detail.

Before introducing the methods of interactivity, it's important to talk about how dimensions, families, and contexts
come together to create the meaningful visualizations you see on your Netdata dashboards.

### Charts, dimensions, families, and contexts

A **chart** is an interactive visualization of one or more collected/calculated metrics. You can see the name (also
known as its unique ID) of a chart by looking at the top-left corner of a chart and finding the parenthesized text. On a
Linux system, one of the first charts on the dashboard will be the system CPU chart, with the name `system.cpu`:

dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/67443082-43b16e80-f5b8-11e9-8d33-d6ee052c6678.png)

A **dimension** is any value that gets shown on a chart. The value can be raw data or calculated values, such as
percentages, aggregates, and more. Most charts will have more than one dimension, in which case it will display each in
a different color. Below, a `system.cpu` chart with many dimensions, such as `user`, `system`, `softirq`, `irq`, and
more.

dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/62721031-2bba4d80-b9c0-11e9-9dca-32403617ce72.png)

A **family** is _one_ instance of a monitored hardware or software resource that needs to be monitored and displayed
separately from similar instances. For example, if your system has multiple partitions, Netdata will create different
families for `/`, `/boot`, `/home`, and so on. Same goes for entire disks, network devices, and more.

![A number of families created for disk
partitions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/67896952-a788e980-fb1a-11e9-880b-2dfb3945c8d6.png)

A **context** groups several charts based on the types of metrics being collected and displayed. For example, the
**Disk** section often has many contexts: `disk.io`, `disk.ops`, `disk.backlog`, `disk.util`, and so on. Netdata uses
this context to create individual charts and then groups them by family. You can always see the context of any chart by
looking at its name or hovering over the chart's date.

### Interact with charts

Now for the fun part. Netdata's charts are fully interactive. You can pan through historical metrics, zoom in and out,
select specific timeframes for further analysis, resize charts, and more. Whenever you use a chart in this way, Netdata
synchronizes all the other charts to match it.

These interactions can also be triggered using the icons on the bottom-right corner of every chart. They are,
respectively, `Pan Left`, `Reset`, `Pan Right`, `Zoom In`, and `Zoom Out`.

You can show and hide individual dimensions by clicking on the. Hiding dimensions simplifies the chart and can help you
better discover exactly which aspect of your system is behaving strangely.

You can resize any chart by clicking-and-dragging the icon on the bottom-right corner of any chart. To restore the chart
to its original height, double-click the same icon.

height](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/80842459-7d41e280-8bb6-11ea-9488-1bc29f94d7f2.gif)

## What's next?

Netdata Cloud users can [build new dashboards](/docs/visualize/create-dashboards.md) in just a few clicks. By
aggregating relevant metrics from any number of nodes onto a single interface, you can respond faster to anomalies,
perform more targeted troubleshooting, or keep tabs on a bird's eye view of your infrastructure.

If you're finished with dashboards for now, skip to Netdata's [health watchdog](/docs/monitor/configure-alarms.md) for
information on how to create or configure alarms, and [send notifications](/docs/monitor/enable-notifications.md) to get
informed when something goes wrong in your infrastructure.
