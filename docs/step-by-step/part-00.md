title: The step-by-step Netdata tutorial
description: Ten parts and a whole lot of monitoring know-how to share.
---

Welcome to Netdata! We're glad you're interested in our health monitoring and performance troubleshooting system.

Because Netdata is entirely open-source software, you can use it free of charge, whether you want to monitor one or ten
thousand systems! Our code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/netdata/netdata).

This tutorial is designed to help you understand what Netdata is, what it's capable of, and how it'll help you learn
more about your systems and applications. If you're completely new to Netdata, or have never tried health
monitoring/performance troubleshooting systems before, this tutorial is perfect for you.

> If you have monitoring experience, or would rather get straight into configuring Netdata to your needs, you can
> also jump straight into code and configurations with the [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started/).

This tutorial contains instructions for Netdata installed on a Linux system. Many of the instructions will work on other
supported operating systems, like FreeBSD and MacOS, but it is not guaranteed.

## Before we get started...

Let's make sure you have Netdata installed on your system!

> If you already installed Netdata, feel free to skip to [Part 01: Netdata's building blocks](/tutorials/part-01/).

The easiest way to install Netdata on a Linux system is our `kickstart-static64.sh` one-line installer. Run this on your
system and let it take care of the rest.

```bash
bash <(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart-static64.sh)
```

Once finished, you'll have Netdata installed, and you'll be set up to get _nightly updates_ to get the latest features,
improvements, and bugfixes.

If this method doesn't work for you, or you want to use a different process, visit our [installation
documentation](/docs/packaging/installer/).

While Netdata can monitor thousands of metrics in real-time without any configuration, you may _want_ to tweak some
settings based on your system's resources.

## Intermediate tutorials
