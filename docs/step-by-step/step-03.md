# Step 3. Monitor more than one system with Netdata

The Netdata agent is _distributed_ by design. That means each agent operates independently from any other, collecting
and creating charts only for the system you installed it on. We made this decision a long time ago to [improve security
and performance](step-01.md).

You might be thinking, "So, now I have to remember all these IP addresses, and type them into my browser
manually, to move from one system to another? Maybe I should just make a bunch of bookmarks. What's a few more tabs
on top of the hundred I have already?"

We get it. That's why we built [Netdata Cloud](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/cloud/), which connects many distributed
agents together for a seamless experience when monitoring an entire infrastructure of Agent-monitored nodes.

Even if you don't have multiple systems right now, keep reading. The instructions to follow will show you how to test
out these features with Netdata demo servers. That way, you'll be able to experience one of Netdata's defining features
right away.

## What you'll learn in this step

In this step of the Netdata guid, we'll talk about the following:

-   [Why you should use Netdata Cloud](#why-use-netdata-cloud)
-   [Get started with Netdata Cloud](#get-started-with-netdata-cloud)
-   [Navigate between dashboards with Visited nodes](#navigate-between-dashboards-with-visited-nodes)

## Why use Netdata Cloud?

Most of our Cloud documentation 

## Get started with Netdata Cloud

## Navigate between dashboards with Visited nodes

## What's next?

Now that you have a Netdata Cloud account with a claimed node (or a few!) and can navigate between your dashboards with
Visited nodes, it's time to learn more about how you can configure Netdata to your liking. From there, you'll be able to
customize your Netdata experience to your exact infrastructure and the information you need.
